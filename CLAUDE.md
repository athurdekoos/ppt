# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is **not a code repository**. It is an OpenTeams brand assets directory containing:

- **OpenTeams_Brand_Guidelines_2025.pdf** — Official brand guidelines document
- **OpenTeams_Template_2025.pptx** — PowerPoint presentation template
- **2025 NEW LOGO/** — Logo files in multiple formats and variants

## Logo Organization

Logos are under `2025 NEW LOGO/` organized by color variant and format:

- **OT_Colored_Logos/** — Full-color logos (horizontal, vertical, favicon; PNG/JPG/SVG)
- **OT_White_Logos/** — White logos for dark backgrounds (AI/SVG/PNG)
- **OT_Black_Logos/** — Black logos for light backgrounds (AI/SVG/PNG)
- **OT_ai_Logos/** — Adobe Illustrator source files
- **Email signature OT logo/** — Sized for email signatures (with/without tagline)

Each variant is available in horizontal and vertical lockups, plus favicon.

## Git Commits

- **Never** include a `Co-Authored-By` line in commit messages. All commits should be authored solely by the user.

## Notes

- There are no build commands, tests, or linting — this is a static assets directory.
- The `~$` prefixed file is a temporary Office lock file and should be ignored.
